  <h2 class="heading">What is Conway's Game of Life?</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Introduced in 1970 by the British mathematician John Horton Conway, the Game of Life is a cellular automatonâ€”a concept that was highlighted by Martin Gardner in his "Mathematical Games" column featured in the October 1970 issue of "Scientific American" magazine. The column notably ignited a remarkable reader engagement, even surpassing the famed Hexaflexagons discourse, which was previously featured in Gardner's series.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">A defining feature of Conway's Game of Life is its Turing completeness, a property denoting a system's theoretical ability to compute any problem given appropriate resources and time. In the framework of the Game of Life, this capability emerges through the interaction of unique patterns that dynamically evolve within the simulated environment.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">How to play</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">In the Game of Life each grid cell can have either one of two states: dead or alive. The Game of Life is controlled by four simple rules which are applied to each grid cell in the simulation domain:</p>
